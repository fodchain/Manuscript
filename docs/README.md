> As the only circulating token on the Forest Network, it will realize circulation at the incentive layer and application level, and build an economic ecology.

When decentralized open services are replacing the centralized
services used by the event, elastic IP addresses are replacing IP
addresses with low security, and peer-to-peer decentralized algorithm
market is also edging out the inefficient monolithic services, a
decentralized network is formed among participants, becoming the
preliminary examples of open services for these systems within the
Internet. Several scientists who participated in the early research of
blockchain technology jointly initiated the Forest Network Protocol in
Silicon Valley and established the Forest Labs. In May 2017, the
laboratory launched Forest Network, that is, the decentralized CoT
network. Forest Network creates a decentralized CoT network protocol, enabling
more nodes to contribute their privacy computing power, private
storage spaces, and network resources through “Forest Network Privacy
Protocol”, thus giving the Forest Network powerful computing with more
storage spaces. Users can obtain sufficient privacy computing and
private storage spaces provided by Forest Network by consuming a
certain amount of gas. Each node of the Forest Network can be
regarded as a "Contributor to the Forest Network System" (hereinafter
referred to as "Contributor"). While providing computing and storage
services, block information on each node is packed, witnessed, and
- 2 -
recorded to obtain rewards from the Forest Network. Besides, Forest
Labs also created a "Forest Network Random Consensus Law" to
provide better privacy security protection for those who used Forest
Network. Forest Network is also an open and inclusive block network. It can be
compatible with most computing and storage devices and IoT devices
through the innovative consensus protocol. As long as the device
satisfies the corresponding data computing power unit, it is eligible to
provide computing power and storage support for the entire network, realize interconnection and create a distributed network of privacy
through encryption algorithms. In this way, the network will receive a
huge amount of computing power and storage, and contributors can
get paid. Whenever we want, we can obtain any unit-level privacy
computing power and storage space through this network.
