Voting rules





- Use FOD to vote

  ```
  push action galaxy.sys voteproducer '{"voter":"four","producer":"four"ï¼Œ"poll":"1000"}' -p four@active
  ```

  Voting ratio: 1:10

  `voter`: voter (T)
  `producer`: voted person (T's F)
  `poll`: number of votes



- F-node and computing power unit

  F's pledge =>> 3000 votes
  Each T NODE computing power unit =>> 1000 votes
