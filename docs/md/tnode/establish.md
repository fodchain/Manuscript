### Forest T Festival Construction



- How the command is executed:

  ```
  java -jar shuttle.jar -u http://F node IP:8523 --wallet-url http://F node IP:10004
  ```

  Example

  ```
  java -jar shuttle.jar -u http://F node address: 8523 --wallet-url http://F node address: 10004 get account wallet #address#
  ```

  

### Prepare the environment

```shell
jdk
#Installation command
Query system version number
echo $(cat /etc/issue|grep Ubuntu|awk '{print $2}'|cut -f 1 -d '.')

18
apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless
20
apt install openjdk-8-jdk-headless
```



### Start building

1. Generate address, key

```
java -jar createKey.jar
```

Output

```
# {
#   "publicKey" : "xxxx",
#   "privateKey" : "xxx",
#   "address" : "xxx"
# }
```

2. Create user

```shell
wallet create -n #address#  --to-console
```

- address The address generated in step 1 needs to be replaced. Also remove the # sign

Output

```shell
# Creating wallet: foda22523ad6ebe61d218bb440b3301a18c07c05222
# Save password to use in the future to unlock this wallet.
# Without password imported keys will not be retrievable.
# "Here is the password, remember to save it"
```

3. Import key

```shell
wallet import -n address --private-key "privateKey"
```

- address The address generated in step 1 needs to be replaced. Also remove the # sign

- The privateKey generated in step 1 of privateKey needs to be replaced

4. Unlock wallet

```
wallet unlock -n address -p password
```

- address The address generated in step 1 needs to be replaced. Also remove the # sign

- password The password generated in step 2 needs to be replaced

5. Link wallet

 ```
   system newaccount galaxy address "publicKey"
 ```

- address The address generated in step 1 needs to be replaced. Also remove the # sign

- The publicKey generated by publicKey in step 1, need to be replaced





### Start box

1. Create a configuration file

```
java -jar shuttle.jar config config_path /root/tree/config.yml
java -jar shuttle.jar config block_chain_url http://F节点地址:8523
# View configuration file
cat /root/tree/config.yml
Output: blockChainUrl: http://F node address: 8523


vim root/tree/config.yml
-------------------------
owner: address
privateKey: privateKey
blockChainUrl: http://F node address: 8523
publicKey: publicKey
```

Fill in the key and address generated in the first step to the corresponding position

2. starting program

```
cd tree/
nohup java -jar -Xms1024m -Xmx4096m -XX:PermSize=512M -XX:MaxPermSize=1024M tree_node-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar> /dev/null 2>&1 &
```



3. Register the box as a T node

```
cd ~


 push action galaxy.sys regtree '{"account":"address", "pubKey":"publicKey","type":"box"}' -p address@active
```

- address The address generated in step 1 needs to be replaced.

- The publicKey generated by publicKey in step 1, need to be replaced



4. Bind F node

```
 push action galaxy.sys delegatebw '{"account":"address","binder":"F-node's wallet address of d","amount":"300.000000 FOD","height":"14000"}' -p address@active
```

- address The address generated in step 1 needs to be replaced.

- The address bound to the F node is at the beginning

If you are prompted: `Passed in an empty public key set`, you need to perform the unlock wallet operation. Step 4 of the beginning of the setup
