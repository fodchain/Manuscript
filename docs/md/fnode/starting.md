- Software conditions

  System suggestion： `ubuntu 18.04 `

  To run other required programs such as shuttle.jar, you need to install the `JDK1.8.0` version

  If your system is what I recommend, maybe you can use the following command to quickly install

  ```shell
  apt install openjdk-8-jre-headless
  ```

**Supplied components**

```
# It is mainly used when you install. Usually use it to manage wallets
shuttle.jar
# The accessories in this directory are an important part of shuttle.jar
walletdir/
#What you need to install fod, you will use it at the beginning

               |param.ini
# It contains everything needed by the F node
